I had the opportunity to meet amazing technologists virtually through Google Code-In. I felt unconfident in the beginning(since it was my first remote mentoring experience). After several tasks, I grasped how other experienced mentors guided partcipants online. I slowly became more confident to give feedback to students on UX/UI design tasks. It is so amazing to see pre-university students who are passionate about learning oopen source technologies. They engage with other participants and mentors on GCI dashboard and work on design, coding, documentation and outreach tasks and then ask for feedback. 

The overall mentorship experience was a fun learning engaging process for me. There is a huge demand of such programs to help pre-university students who want to contribute to organization.

Nobody is born knowing how to create a pull request(#PR :p), implement features.

Let's learn together. :D
