I am always been fascinated with how things are build and how things work. I am a person who is naturally curious and love to ask questions even though how senseless or how random are they.

Hey! No question is senseless. Mind it

I feel that if you don't ask questions it's like you are not involved and well you are just present and your brain is somewhere else. UNderstand it like this.
I don't know what I am writing but get this.

Questions are just a way to show someone that you are really interested and you are listening. There is a difference between hearing and listening :)

## Let's talk about BIOS and Kernel

### First BIOS

BIOS(Basic Input Output System), the first software program that runs when you start up your system. First time when you press the power button, your BIOS goes in action. BIOS Tells your OS what to do. 
But what it does?
It sets up all the params for Hardware that's installed inside of your computer. BIOS is stored on ROM chip on motherboard.
BIOS can be modified if you choose to do so. BIOS changes to maximize performance and speed of their computer. However the average everyday person wiill want to stay clear od BIOS[ DON'T TOUCH IT HAHAHA ] 

You may need to change BIOS when you install a piece of hardware inside your computer.
