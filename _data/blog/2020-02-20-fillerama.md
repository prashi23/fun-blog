Hi! Thanks for landing here. I am glad that you are interested in knowing me.
If you wanna talk about life and tech in general .
# Hit me up! I love to meet people virtually or on a coffee.

I am Prashi from New Delhi, India. I love to time boxing my tasks super efficient. A naturally curious person, a good listener but my one of my beggest pet peeve is when someone tells me to be quite.

I'm interested in learning how things work and how they are build. I am always looking for hands on development and building solutions in innovative ways. Presently, I am pursuing masters in commputer science from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women(IGDTUW). I volunteer in communities and really passionate promoting minorities in tech.

# A short story about me.

> I received my degree, Bachelor in Computer Science(Hons) from University of Delhi, India in 2018. I did C/C++ programming, insanely hooked and then I received my degree. At the time of graduation, I played tennis a lot and I really enjoyed studying about compilers and operating system because those are the subjects that teaches you how a line of code actually works and how a computer works, what is going behing that is giving you output.
I was not sure whether tech is right for me or I am right for tech. Will I really fit in the tech industry? Is tech the male dominant society? I had lots of questions and I was not aware of tech communities and especially women in tech communities.

> I decided to pursue my masters in computer science from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women(IGDTUW), a women college where each woman is unique in her own way. Well, I believe that everyone has a different story and people do a lot of different things. IGDTUW is unique in its own way. Then, I got to know about so many different opportunities like Hackatons, GitHub campus experts, Microsoft Student Partners, Open source Development, meetups and community involvement. I started enjoying meetups and I love to volunteer in meetups because it's a place where you are super passionate about promoting women and minorities in tech and energising them. It's a place where you can seek help and help other people with the skills you have. ##TOGETHER WE RISE

# What do I do?

> I am recently introduced to Game Development(Unreal Engine and C++). I am working on that and developing my skills. My past experiences are in academic research, data science and machine learning. I am familiar with web development and I love to hack in hackathons. If you wanna collab in a project or in a hackathon. Feel free to ping me!
