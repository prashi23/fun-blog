I am always been fascinated with how things are build and how things work. I am a person who is naturally curious and love to ask questions even though how senseless or how random are they.

Hey! No question is senseless. Mind it

I feel that if you don't ask questions it's like you are not involved and well you are just present and your brain is somewhere else. UNderstand it like this.
I don't know what I am writing but get this.

Questions is just a way to show something that you are.
