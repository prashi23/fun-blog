Everyone has that mail THANK YOU FOR APPLYING BUT WE ARE REALLY SORRY THAT ANOTHER CANDIDATE IS BETTER THAT YOU!

Everyone has been in that position and saying ANOTHER REJECTION! yet another rejection!

OH GAWD! WILL I EVER GET THAT ACCEPTANCE MAIL.


Failures are important but do you know what is more important?

The most important thing is to learn from that failure.

Now you must be thinking that LOL! Everyone says it. This is nothing new.

I agree. This is not new but you have to believe this.
